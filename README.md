## Description ðŸ’¬

This React app helps users manage friends and split bills easily. It displays a list of friends, each showing whether they owe money or are owed. Users can add new friends by entering their name and a custom image URL. The app allows users to select a friend and split a bill by specifying the total amount and how much each person paid. It also tracks balances after splitting the bill, updating the amounts accordingly.
